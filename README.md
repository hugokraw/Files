**SIGMA Protocol and Paper** The SIGMA Key Exchange Protocol, originally designed for the IPsec Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol, became part of both IKEv1 and IKEv2 
and years later was adopted by TLS 1.3 as the basis for the cryptographic design of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol. The protocol was originally designed by 
Hugo Krawczyk and first specified for IKEv1 in RFC 2104. After its inclusion in IKEv2, a first formal analysis of SIGMA was published by Ran Canetti 
and Hugo Krawczyk at Crypto 2002. A paper with detailed but informal rationale for SIGMA, incluyendo its comparison to other key exchange protocols, was
published at Crypto 2003 as a companion to Hugo Krawczyk's invited lecture at that conference. A more complete version was originally posted in a public 
repository that is not accessible anymore. For those interested, it is now posted [here] (https://github.com/hugokraw/Files/blob/main/SIGMA-AKE-full.pdf).
